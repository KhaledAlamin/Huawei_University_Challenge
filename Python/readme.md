The developed neural network is based on a classification model that can detect the existence of a car in an image; the model has been deployed in STM32F429. It trained on a classified image (training set) on an external workstation (PC). Moreover, the unclassified images (test set) after being converted to grey-scale for performance purposes are sent via virtual COMM to the STM to decide (based on the fitted model) either the image containing a car or not and display the result on the screen. The neural network structure is consist of the input layer (unclassified image), three hidden layers (6:6:5) every hidden layer consist of activation function and an output layer which is one of the binary number (0,1) where "1" represents car found or not "0" otherwise. Our application can handle up to 2 frames per second (2f/s) with a resolution of 64x64
